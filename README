A simple sudoku puzzle solver that can solve many, but NOT ALL sudoku puzzles.


Doing a sudoku puzzle used to bug me because I thought it was as simple 
matter of marking off non-possiblities and the answer revealing itself.  
I wrote this solver to prove this.  

I found that my approach was insufficient when it couldn't solve a 
published sudoku that I was using for testing.  In researching why, I came 
across Sudopedia:

which opened my eyes.  


In 2012, I came across this wonderful writeup by Peter Norvig:

Considering the abundance of other complete solvers and the non-standard
format of my sudoku data, there isn't much point in further development.
